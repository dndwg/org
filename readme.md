# The Digital News Delivery Working Group 

We are dedicated to finding and creating ways to distribute news that are web-based, publisher-hosted, and open source.

Most news-industry innovation efforts to date have focused on newsgathering and storytelling -- areas of obvious interest to reporters and editors. While we applaud those efforts, DNDWG is focused on what happens <em>after</em> the traditional work of a journalist is done -- the delivery of news to actual consumers.

For two decades, news organizations have essentially ceded this job to large public tech companies, ultimately to disastrous effect. Working journalists, being great problem <em>describers</em> by nature, have recently documented in great detail all the failings and repercussions of this approach for both the news industry and society at large.

DNDWG is dedicated to <em>solving</em> problems around news delivery, not just describing them, in collaboration with journalists, technologists, and other stakeholders.
