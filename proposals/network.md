# Network

A federated network of news sites that effectively turns them into a social network.

Proposed features:

- Single sign-in system using tools from MIT's Solid project. (See https://solid.mit.edu)
- Users can follow RSS feeds from the site they're visiting or from other sites on the network.
- Users can follow one another.

General idea here is borrowed from blog post at http://bit.ly/2EXHPUQ
